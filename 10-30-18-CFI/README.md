# Topic: 
Performance Analysis of Software Security Techniques like CFI, DFI

We are using Linux Distro Ubuntu 16.04.4 based GCC 5.4.0.  



## CFI

We rank and catergorize CFI algorithms from the most fine grind to less fine grind, and compare their performance. 

Define grind of CFI algorithm:
loop termination conditions like indirect pointer levels, subroutine numbers and memory regions it touches. 

"The CFG in question can be defined by
analysisâ€”source-code analysis, binary analysis, or execution profiling. For our experiments,
we focus on CFGs derived by a static binary analysis. CFGs can also be defined by
explicit security policies, for example written as security automata [Schneider 2000]"

"Whereas CFI enforcement can potentially be done in several ways, we rely on a combination
of lightweight static verification and machine-code rewriting that instruments software
with runtime checks."
